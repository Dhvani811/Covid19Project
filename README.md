Final Project - COVID-19 and its effect on the stock market 


Explain why you chose the graphs you did?

In order to understand how the stock market performed in comparision to the COVID cases and deaths, it is best to plot a line chart with multiple lines representing each field.

There are two y-axis, the left y-axis is for the active cases and death rates. The right y-axis is for stock prices. The x-axis represents the time.
